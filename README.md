# Week 3 - Exercise 01 - Atomic Design

## Exercise: Analyzing Atomic Design Principles

1. **Find a Website**: Explore the internet and select a website that captures your interest. It could be any website â€“ from your favorite blog to an e-commerce site.

2. **Screenshots**: Take screenshots of different sections of the chosen website. Capture the homepage, a product page, or any other relevant pages. Ensure you have a variety of components to analyze.

3. **Identify Atoms**, Molecules, and Organisms: Using the principles of Atomic Design, identify and label the atomic elements (individual components), molecules (groups of components working together), and organisms (larger sections or complete layouts).

4. **Explain Choices**: Provide a brief explanation of your choices. Why did you categorize certain elements as atoms, molecules, or organisms? What design principles or functionalities influenced your decisions?

5. **Reflect on Consistency**: Reflect on the consistency in design patterns across different pages of the website. Are there recurring atoms or molecules that contribute to a cohesive user experience?

**Submit**: Compile your findings into a Readme.md file, including the screenshots and your analysis. Submit the Readme.md through the GitHub Classroom by Friday 16:00.
